        lead={`Some positioning problems look like communications problems. They're not. They're structural — rooted in how a firm or its leadership is placed within a competitive market, how its narrative aligns with its actual trajectory, and whether the architecture underneath the messaging can hold weight.

We work at that level. Before amplification. Before visibility. At the point where clarity either exists — or doesn't.

We work with enterprise technology leaders and firms who want to determine their own position in the market — not the way market forces have placed them.`}

                  Two decades of working inside enterprise technology ecosystems — across founders, country
                  heads, scaling firms, and market transitions — produce a particular kind of clarity.
